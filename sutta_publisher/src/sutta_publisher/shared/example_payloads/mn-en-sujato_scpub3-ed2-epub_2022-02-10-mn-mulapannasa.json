        "mn140:31.2": "Identification is a disease, a boil, a dart. ",

        "mn140:32.3": "Mendicant, you should remember this brief analysis of the six elements.” ",
        "mn140:33.1": "Then Venerable Pukkusāti thought, ",
        "mn140:33.2": "“It seems the Teacher has come to me! The Holy One has come to me! The fully awakened Buddha has come to me!” He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, and said, ",
        "mn140:33.3": "“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to presume to address the Buddha as ‘reverend’. ",
        "mn140:33.4": "Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” ",
        "mn140:33.5": "“Indeed, mendicant, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. ",
        "mn140:33.6": "But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. ",
        "mn140:33.7": "For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” ",
        "mn140:34.1": "“Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” ",
        "mn140:34.2": "“But mendicant, are your bowl and robes complete?” ",
        "mn140:34.3": "“No, sir, they are not.” ",
        "mn140:34.4": "“The Realized Ones do not ordain those whose bowl and robes are incomplete.” ",
        "mn140:35.1": "And then Venerable Pukkusāti approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
        "mn140:35.2": "But while he was wandering in search of a bowl and robes, a stray cow took his life. ",
        "mn140:36.1": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
        "mn140:36.2": "“Sir, the gentleman named Pukkusāti, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away. ",
        "mn140:36.3": "Where has he been reborn in his next life?” ",
        "mn140:36.4": "“Mendicants, Pukkusāti was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. ",
        "mn140:36.5": "With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.” ",
        "mn140:36.6": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
        "mn140:36.7": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. ",
        "mn140:4.1": "Then the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side. He sat down cross-legged, with his body straight, and established mindfulness right there. ",
        "mn140:4.2": "He spent most of the night sitting meditation, ",
        "mn140:4.3": "and so did Pukkusāti. ",
        "mn140:4.4": "Then it occurred to the Buddha, ",
        "mn140:4.5": "“This gentleman’s conduct is impressive. ",
        "mn140:4.6": "Why don’t I question him?” ",
        "mn140:4.7": "So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti, ",
        "mn140:5.1": "“In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?” ",
        "mn140:5.10": "There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” ",
        "mn140:5.11": "“But have you ever seen that Buddha? ",
        "mn140:5.12": "Would you recognize him if you saw him?” ",
        "mn140:5.13": "“No, I’ve never seen him, ",
        "mn140:5.14": "and I wouldn’t recognize him if I did.” ",
        "mn140:5.2": "“Reverend, there is the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family. ",
        "mn140:5.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
        "mn140:5.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
        "mn140:5.5": "I’ve gone forth in his name. ",
        "mn140:5.6": "That Blessed One is my Teacher, ",
        "mn140:5.7": "and I believe in his teaching.” ",
        "mn140:5.8": "“But mendicant, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” ",
        "mn140:5.9": "“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī. ",
        "mn140:6.1": "Then it occurred to the Buddha, ",
        "mn140:6.2": "“This gentleman has gone forth in my name. ",
        "mn140:6.3": "Why don’t I teach him the Dhamma?” ",
        "mn140:6.4": "So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti, ",
        "mn140:6.5": "“Mendicant, I shall teach you the Dhamma. ",
        "mn140:6.6": "Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” ",
        "mn140:6.7": "“Yes, reverend,” replied Pukkusāti. ",
        "mn140:6.8": "The Buddha said this: ",
        "mn140:7.1": "“‘This person has six elements, six fields of contact, and eighteen mental preoccupations. ",
        "mn140:7.2": "They have four foundations, standing on which the streams of identification don’t flow. And when the streams of identification don’t flow, they’re called a sage at peace. ",
        "mn140:7.3": "Don’t neglect wisdom, preserve truth, foster generosity, and train only for peace.’ ",
        "mn140:7.4": "This is the recitation passage for the analysis of the elements. ",
        "mn140:8.1": "‘This person has six elements.’ ",
        "mn140:8.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
