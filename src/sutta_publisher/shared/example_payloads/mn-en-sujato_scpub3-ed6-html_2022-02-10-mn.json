The word “middle” refers to the length of the individual discourses. This is perhaps the most popular collection of early discourses. It contains a wide variety of teachings, many of them presented as narratives between the Buddha and a diverse range of his contemporaries. The collection parallels the Madhyamāgama (MA) of the Sarvāstivāda school, which survives as a translation in the Chinese canon.",

        "mn26:16.20": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’ ",
        "mn26:16.21": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. ",
        "mn26:16.22": "So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him, ",
        "mn26:16.23": "‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’ ",
        "mn26:16.24": "‘He had, reverend.’ ",

        "mn26:16.26": "‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate ",
        "mn26:16.27": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! ",
        "mn26:16.28": "So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it. ",
        "mn26:16.29": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it. ",
        "mn26:16.3": "Uddaka replied, ",
        "mn26:16.30": "So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew. ",
        "mn26:16.31": "Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma. ",
        "mn26:16.32": "Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’ ",
        "mn26:16.33": "And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka, son of Rāma, placed me in the position of a teacher, and honored me with lofty praise. ",
        "mn26:16.34": "Then it occurred to me, ",
        "mn26:16.35": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ ",
        "mn26:16.36": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
        "mn26:16.4": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
        "mn26:16.5": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",
        "mn26:16.6": "I quickly memorized that teaching. ",
        "mn26:16.7": "So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. ",
        "mn26:16.8": "Then it occurred to me, ",
        "mn26:16.9": "‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” ",
        "mn26:17.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā. ",
        "mn26:17.2": "There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village for alms. ",
        "mn26:17.3": "Then it occurred to me, ",
        "mn26:17.4": "‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to go for alms. ",
        "mn26:17.5": "This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation.’ ",
        "mn26:17.6": "So I sat down right there, thinking, ",
        "mn26:17.7": "‘This is good enough for meditation.’ ",
        "mn26:18.1": "And so, being myself liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, I sought the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it. Being myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, I sought the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it.

        "mn26:18.2": "Knowledge and vision arose in me: ",
        "mn26:18.3": "‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’ ",
        "mn26:19.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
        "mn26:19.10": "This teaching is not easily understood ",
        "mn26:19.11": "by those mired in greed and hate. ",
        "mn26:19.12": "Those besotted by greed can’t see ",
        "mn26:19.13": "what’s subtle, going against the stream, ",
        "mn26:19.14": "deep, hard to see, and very fine, ",
        "mn26:19.15": "for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’ ",
        "mn26:19.16": "So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. ",
        "mn26:19.2": "‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. ",
        "mn26:19.3": "But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. ",
        "mn26:19.4": "It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. ",
        "mn26:19.5": "It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. ",
        "mn26:19.6": "And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’ ",
        "mn26:19.7": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me: ",
        "mn26:19.8": "‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this, ",
        "mn26:19.9": "enough with trying to explain it! ",
        "mn26:2.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
        "mn26:2.2": "Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him, ",
        "mn26:2.3": "“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. ",
        "mn26:2.4": "It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",

        "mn26:2.6": "Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",
        "mn26:2.7": "“Yes, reverend,” they replied. ",
        "mn26:20.1": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, thought, ",

        "mn26:20.3": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. ",
        "mn26:20.4": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, ",

        "mn26:20.7": "There will be those who understand the teaching!’ ",
        "mn26:20.8": "That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. ",
        "mn26:20.9": "Then he went on to say: ",
        "mn26:21.1": "Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings. ",
        "mn26:21.10": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there. ",
        "mn26:21.2": "And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach.

        "mn26:21.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater.

        "mn81:20.5": "So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left. ",
        "mn81:20.6": "Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, ",

        "mn81:20.8": "“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.” ",
        "mn81:20.9": "Then Ghaṭīkāra thought, ",

        "mn81:21.15": "“It was the mendicants, dear. It seems the Buddha’s hut is leaking.” ",
        "mn81:21.16": "Then Ghaṭīkāra thought, ",

        "mn81:21.19": "Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week. ",
        "mn81:21.2": "Now at that time my hut leaked. ",
        "mn81:21.20": "Then the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three months, but no rain fell on it. ",

        "mn81:22.2": "Then one of the king’s men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said, ",

        "mn91:36.6": "Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, ",

        "mn91:36.9": "Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha: ",
        "mn91:37.1": "“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! ",
        "mn91:37.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",

        "mn91:37.5": "Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” ",
        "mn91:37.6": "The Buddha consented in silence. ",
        "mn91:37.7": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
        "mn91:38.1": "And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, ",
        "mn91:38.2": "“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” ",
        "mn91:38.3": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. ",

        "mn91:39.2": "Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away. ",
        "mn91:39.3": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
        "mn91:39.4": "“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away. ",
        "mn91:39.5": "Where has he been reborn in his next life?” ",
        "mn91:39.6": "“Mendicants, the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. ",

        "mn91:39.8": "That is what the Buddha said. ",

That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.

They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.
