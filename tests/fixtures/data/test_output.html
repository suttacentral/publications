<h2>1. Talk on Wanderers <a id='dn1:0.3'></a></h2>
<p><span class='evam'><a class='bj' id='bj7.2'>BJ 7.2</a>So I have heard. <a id='dn1:1.1.1'></a></span>At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. <a id='dn1:1.1.2'></a>The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his pupil, the brahmin student Brahmadatta. <a id='dn1:1.1.3'></a>Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, <a id='dn1:1.1.4'></a>but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. <a id='dn1:1.1.5'></a>And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. <a id='dn1:1.1.6'></a></p>
<p><a class='cck' id='cck9.2'>CCK 9.2</a>Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. <a id='dn1:1.2.1'></a>And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. <a id='dn1:1.2.2'></a>There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, <a id='dn1:1.2.3'></a>but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. <a id='dn1:1.2.4'></a>And so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. <a id='dn1:1.2.5'></a></p>
<p><a class='bj' id='bj7.4'>BJ 7.4</a>Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of evaluation came up: <a id='dn1:1.3.1'></a></p>
<p>“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse attitudes of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. <a id='dn1:1.3.2'></a>For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, <a id='dn1:1.3.3'></a>while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. <a id='dn1:1.3.4'></a>And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” <a id='dn1:1.3.5'></a></p>
<p><a class='csp1ed' id='csp1ed6.3'>CSP1ED 6.3</a>When the Buddha found out about this discussion on evaluation among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, <a id='dn1:1.4.1'></a>“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” <a id='dn1:1.4.2'></a></p>
<p>The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, <a id='dn1:1.4.3'></a> <a id='dn1:1.4.4'></a> <a id='dn1:1.4.5'></a> <a id='dn1:1.4.6'></a> <a id='dn1:1.4.7'></a> <a id='dn1:1.4.8'></a>“This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” <a id='dn1:1.4.9'></a></p>
<p><a class='cck' id='cck9.4'>CCK 9.4</a>“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated. <a id='dn1:1.5.1'></a>You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone. <a id='dn1:1.5.2'></a>If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?” <a id='dn1:1.5.3'></a></p>
<p>“No, sir.” <a id='dn1:1.5.4'></a></p>
<p><a class='lv' id='lv1.7'>LV 1.7</a>“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: <a id='dn1:1.6.1'></a>‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ <a id='dn1:1.6.2'></a></p>
<p><a class='bj' id='bj7.6'>BJ 7.6</a>If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. <a id='dn1:1.6.3'></a>You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. <a id='dn1:1.6.4'></a>If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: <a id='dn1:1.6.5'></a>‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ <a id='dn1:1.6.6'></a></p>nan<a id='nan'></a>
