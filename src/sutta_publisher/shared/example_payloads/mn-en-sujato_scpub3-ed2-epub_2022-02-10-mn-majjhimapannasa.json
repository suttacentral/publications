        "mn79:3.3": "Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, ",

        "mn79:6.2": "“Master Gotama, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ ",
        "mn79:6.3": "When I asked them a question about the past, they dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness. ",

        "mn79:8.2": "How should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details, like the Buddha? ",

        "mn81:20.9": "Then Ghaṭīkāra thought, ",

        "mn81:21.10": "“Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?” ",

        "mn81:21.2": "Now at that time my hut leaked. ",
        "mn81:21.20": "Then the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three months, but no rain fell on it. ",
        "mn81:21.21": "And that, great king, is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is like.’ ",

        "mn81:21.7": "“Then go to the workshop and strip the grass.” ",
        "mn81:21.8": "So that’s what they did. ",

        "mn91:34.1": "When he said this, Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: ",
        "mn91:34.2": "“I am the brahmin Brahmāyu, Master Gotama! ",
        "mn91:34.3": "I am the brahmin Brahmāyu!” ",
        "mn91:35.1": "Then that assembly, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, ",
        "mn91:35.2": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing, ",
        "mn91:35.3": "that Brahmāyu, who is so well-known and famous, should show the Buddha such utmost devotion.” ",
        "mn91:35.4": "Then the Buddha said to Brahmāyu, ",

        "mn91:35.6": "So Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seat. ",

        "mn91:36.3": "He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. ",
        "mn91:36.4": "And when the Buddha knew that Brahmāyu’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: ",
        "mn91:36.5": "suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. ",
        "mn91:36.6": "Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, ",

        "mn91:36.8": "“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” ",
        "mn91:36.9": "Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha: ",
        "mn91:37.1": "“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! ",
        "mn91:37.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
        "mn91:37.3": "I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
        "mn91:37.4": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. ",
        "mn91:37.5": "Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” ",
        "mn91:37.6": "The Buddha consented in silence. ",
        "mn91:37.7": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
        "mn91:38.1": "And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, ",
        "mn91:38.2": "“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” ",
        "mn91:38.3": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
        "mn91:38.4": "For seven days, Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. ",
        "mn91:39.1": "When the seven days had passed, the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan lands. ",
        "mn91:39.2": "Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away. ",
        "mn91:39.3": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
        "mn91:39.4": "“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away. ",
        "mn91:39.5": "Where has he been reborn in his next life?” ",
        "mn91:39.6": "“Mendicants, the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. ",
        "mn91:39.7": "With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.” ",
        "mn91:39.8": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
        "mn91:39.9": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. ",
        "mn91:4.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a student named Uttara. He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum.",
        "mn91:4.2": "Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddha’s presence in the land of the Videhans, and added: ",

        "mn91:5.9": "But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. ",
        "mn91:6.1": "“Yes, sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering. ",

        "mn91:6.2": "Traveling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
        "mn91:6.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, ",
        "mn91:6.4": "and scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. ",

        "mn91:6.7": "whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. ",

        "mn91:6.9": "“This brahmin student Uttara sees all the marks except for two, ",
        "mn91:7.1": "So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. ",
        "mn91:7.2": "And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. ",
